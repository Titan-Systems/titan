[Snowflake Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-view)

Represents a view in Snowflake, which is a virtual table created by a stored query on the data.
Views are used to simplify complex queries, improve security, or enhance performance.

```yaml
views:
  - name: some_view
    owner: SYSADMIN
