# DatabaseRole

[Snowflake Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-database-role)

A database role in Snowflake is a collection of privileges that can be assigned to users or other roles within a specific database context. It is used to manage access control and permissions at the database level.

database_role = DatabaseRole(
    name="some_database_role",
    database="some_database",
    owner="USERADMIN",
    tags={"department": "finance"},
    comment="This role is for database-specific access control."
)
```

### YAML

```yaml
database_roles:
  - name: some_database_role
    database: some_database
    owner: USERADMIN
    tags:
      department: finance
    comment: This role is for database-specific access control.
```
