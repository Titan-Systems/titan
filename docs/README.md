# `titan core` - Snowflake infrastructure as code

Titan Core helps you provision, deploy, and secure resources in Snowflake. It replaces tools like Terraform, Schemachange, or Permifrost.

Deploy any Snowflake resource, including users, roles, schemas, databases, integrations, pipes, stages, functions, stored procedures, and more. Convert adhoc, bug-prone SQL management scripts into simple, repeatable configuration.

Titan Core is for:

* DevOps engineers looking to automate and manage Snowflake infrastructure.
* Analytics engineers working with dbt who want to manage Snowflake resources without macros.
* Data engineers needing a reliable tool for deploying and managing Snowflake resources.
* Organizations that prefer a git-based workflow for infrastructure management.
* Teams seeking to replace Terraform for Snowflake-related tasks.
